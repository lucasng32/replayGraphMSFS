# Sky Dolly
Sky Dolly - The black sheep for your flight recordings.

## About
Sky Dolly connects to a running Flight Simulator 2020 instance and records various simulation variables, for replay.

![Sky Dolly v0.5.0](./img/SkyDolly-v0.6.0.png)

The connection is made via SimConnect, a standard API introduced with Flight Simulator X to connect with the flight simulator.

## Features
* Record / Pause / Play
* Settable recording sample rate: fixed or variable ("auto")
* Adjustable replay speed ("slow motion", "timelapse")
* Position and basic flight control simulation variables (ailerons, rudder, flaps, gears, ...) are recorded
* Basic CSV import & export

Watch a comparison of the various sample rates on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfgkY0eXL4w):

For new and upcoming features also refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Basic Usage

* Start a flight
* Click on "Record" (key R)
* You may pause recording (key P)
* Stop recording (key R) and click on "Play" (spacebar)
* Adjust the replay speed and seek the play position, also during replay
