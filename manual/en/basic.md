# Basic Usage

[Index](index.md) \| [Basic Usage](basic.md)

This chapter describes the basic usage of Sky Dolly, specifically recording and replaying a flight.

## Connection With The Flight Simulator
Sky Dolly communicates with the *flight simulator* via the SimConnect API, an application programming interface which allows external applications such as Sky Dolly (the *client* application) to communicate with the *flight simulator* (the *server* application).

While certain functionality like managing the *logbook* or exporting a *flight* does not require an active connection recording and replaying a *flight* certainly does. The good news: Sky Dolly automatically handles the connection with the *flight simulator*, as soon and when such a connection is required, for instance when pressing the *record* button. However the requirement is that the *flight simulator* is already running at that point and accepting such connection requests.

For all practical matters it also means that an *active* flight must be in progress. For MSFS 2020 this means that you have selected a departure on the world map, clicked the yellow "READY TO FLY" button and are essentially sitting in the cockpit, ready to start your engines or ready for take-off.
```

## Recording Your First Flight
The following steps will guide you through the process of recording a flight and monitoring its progress in Sky Dolly.

At any time an *active* flight is in progress in the *flight simulator*, switch to the Sky Dolly windows and:

- Click the *Record* button (or press key **R**)
- Switch back to the *flight simulator* windows and perform your flight
- Once done with the flight switch again to the Sky Dolly window and stop the recording by pressing on the *Stop* button
