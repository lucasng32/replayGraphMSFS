# Basic Usage

This chapter describes the basic usage of Sky Dolly, specifically recording and replaying a flight.

## Connection With The Flight Simulator
Sky Dolly communicates with the *flight simulator* via the SimConnect API, an application programming interface which allows external applications such as Sky Dolly (the *client* application) to communicate with the *flight simulator* (the *server* application).

While certain functionality like managing the *logbook* or exporting a *flight* does not require an active connection recording and replaying a *flight* certainly does. The good news: Sky Dolly automatically handles the connection with the *flight simulator*, as soon and when such a connection is required, for instance when pressing the *record* button. However the requirement is that the *flight simulator* is already running at that point and accepting such connection requests.

For all practical matters it also means that an *active* flight must be in progress. For MSFS 2020 as an example this usually means that you have selected a departure on the world map, clicked the yellow "Fly now" button and are essentially sitting in the cockpit and ready to fly.

## Recording Your First Flight
The following steps will guide you through the process of recording a flight and monitoring its progress in Sky Dolly.
