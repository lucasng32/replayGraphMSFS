## Download
For the time being Sky Dolly is distributed in a self-containing ZIP archive, which is available from the following locations:

- [flightsim.to/skydolly](https://flightsim.to/file/9067/sky-dolly)
- [github.com/till213/skydolly](https://github.com/till213/SkyDolly/releases)

> Older releases are also available on [github.com]((https://github.com/till213/SkyDolly/releases)
). On [flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to/file/9067/sky-dolly))you can also get notified about updates and engage in the discussion forum.

## Checksums
The content of both locations is identical and the integrity of the ZIP archive can be verified via the [published SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/till213/SkyDolly/SHASUM256).

## Compile From Source
Sky Dolly is open source ([source acode vailable here]((https://github.com/till213/SkyDolly))) and can be built as described in the [build instructions](https://github.com/till213/SkyDolly/BUILD.md).

## Installation
Currently there exists no "installer". So installation is a simple matter of unzipping the ZIP archive. Optional steps such as associating the Sky Dolly logbook files (*.sdlog) are described below.

- Unzip the ZIP archive to any location
- A folder named SkyDolly-v[version] (e.g. *SkyDolly-v0.10.0*) will be created, containing the main executable file *SkyDolly.exe*
- That's it!

You can now launch Sky Dolly by double-clicking on *SkyDolly.exe*.

### Associate Logbooks With Sky Dolly
After you have launched Sky Dolly for the first time a logbook will have been created, by default in folder:

```
C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\Sky Dolly\
```

- Right-click on the file *Sky Dolly.sdlog* in that folder
- Choose *Open with...*
- Navigate to the Sky Dolly installation folder and select the executable *SkyDolly.exe*

From now on you should be able to open *logbooks* by double-clicking on them.

## Uninstall Sky Dolly

- Remove the installation folder SkyDolly-v[version] (e.g. *SkyDolly-v0.10.0*)
- Optional: remove the logbooks, by default located in folder C:\Users\\[Username]\Documents\Sky Dolly\
